## For each terminal window command, add an explanation to the following list

- `python3 src/display_course_name.py`: runs the python code in the terminal
- `git commit`: Locally saves changes to the directory
- `gradle grade`: runs automated checks to determine if the assignment meets all requirements

## What was the greatest technical challenge that you faced and how did you overcome it?

The biggest challenge I faced was ensuring I kept the format consistent while reordering the lists, and I overcame this by carefully observing the format while relocating it.

## After completing this assignment, what is task that you want to practice more? Why?

I would like to practice using Github because I am unsure if I correctly commited and pushed my code.

## After completing this assignment, what is one experience for which you are grateful?

I am grateful for the experience of getting comfortable editing in VSCode
